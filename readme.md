sudo npm install -g typescript ==> instal typescript

tsc -v ==> check typescript version

let message = 'Hello World'; ==> variable

node main.js ==> running the file

tsc main --watch ==> automatically compile typescript file and see for any changes

Some important points
    - Same name variables cant be declared again
    - let variables can be declared without initialization whereas const is always declared with a value
    - Const variable once declared cannot be reassigned
    - unknown type is similar to any, difference being it doesnt allow any different atttributes or methods which any supports
